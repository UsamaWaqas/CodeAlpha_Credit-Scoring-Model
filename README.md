Objective
The goal of this project is to develop a credit scoring model that predicts the creditworthiness of individuals based on historical financial data using classification algorithms.

Dataset
A sample dataset (credit_data.csv) was created with the following features:

Age: Age of the individual.
Income: Annual income.
Employment Status: Employment type (e.g., Employed, Self-Employed, Unemployed).
Credit History: Quality of credit history (e.g., Good, Average, Poor).
Loan Amount: Requested loan amount.
Loan Term: Duration of the loan.
Debt-to-Income Ratio: Ratio of debt to income.
Existing Debts: Total existing debts.
Number of Credit Accounts: Total credit accounts held.
Late Payment Records: Number of late payments in history.
Creditworthiness: Target variable indicating creditworthiness (1 for approved, 0 for rejected).
Methodology
Data Preprocessing:

Load the dataset and handle missing values.
Encode categorical variables (e.g., Employment Status and Credit History).
Ensure all feature columns are numeric.
Data Splitting:

Split the data into training and testing sets (70% training, 30% testing).
Feature Scaling:

Standardize features using StandardScaler to ensure uniformity in the model's performance.
Model Training:

Train a Random Forest classifier on the training dataset.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
Hyperparameter Tuning:

Use Grid Search to find the best hyperparameters for the Random Forest model to improve its performance.
Results
The model achieved an accuracy of 100% on the test set, which is a perfect prediction on the small dataset.
The confusion matrix and classification report indicated that all instances were classified correctly, with perfect precision, recall, and F1-scores.
Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates the implementation of a credit scoring model using a basic dataset. The use of Random Forest as a classification algorithm provided an excellent fit for this small dataset. However, due to the limited size and variety of the data, the results may not generalize well to larger, more complex datasets. Future work could involve:

Expanding the dataset with more diverse and realistic examples.
Exploring other classification algorithms for potential improvements.
Implementing additional features such as credit utilization and payment history.
This project serves as a foundational example of building a machine learning model for credit scoring, illustrating key concepts in data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
